        Alpha Chi Sigma is the only professional chemistry fraternity. It was founded in 1902 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Mizzou's Delta Chapter was founded in 1907 and is now the 2nd oldest continually active chapter of the fraternity. Alpha Chi Sigma is more than 100 years old with more than 70,000 members. We focus on uniting both men and women, whether college students or professionals, through fraternal ties and the common interest of chemistry. We strive to form strong friendships, promote chemistry, and to aid our brothers in their chemistry-related ambitions. Although we are primarily chemistry focused, our fraternity has members from many other majors including biology, BIOCHEMISTRY, chemical engineering, other engineering, computer science, pre-med, and much more!
