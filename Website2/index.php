        Alpha Chi Sigma is a professional chemistry fraternity. The Delta Chapter at Mizzou was founded in 1907 and is now the 2nd oldest continually active chapter of the fraternity (sucks to suck, Beta and Chi). Alpha Chi Sigma has more than 70,000 members across the nation. We focus on uniting both men and women, whether college students or professionals, through fraternal ties and the common interest of chemistry. We strive to form strong friendships, promote chemistry, and to aid our brothers in their ambitions.
