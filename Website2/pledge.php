        <h1>Sacrificial Sign Ups</h1>
        <p>Most people think the chemical sciences take advantage of natural laws of nature. That's fake news. Alpha Chi Sigma is devoted to keeping chemistry working by making deals with several higher powers. (To be honest, we lost track of which one helps us sometime in the 70's) If you would be interested in being this decade's sacrifice let us know at one of the pledge events so we can get you on the waitlist.</p>
